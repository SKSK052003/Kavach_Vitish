The security system will use a camera equipped with OpenCV to monitor a restricted area, such as a laboratory or server room. The system will detect and identify individuals entering the area by comparing their face to a pre-defined list of authorized personnel.
When an unauthorized individual is detected, the system will use Twilio's messaging service to send an alert to authorized personnel, including a timestamp of the event using Datetime. The message could include a photo of the individual and their location within the restricted area.
Authorized personnel can respond to the alert by using Twilio to send commands back to the system, such as sounding an alarm, locking down the area, or calling the police.
This project would require integrating OpenCV for face recognition, Twilio for messaging and communication, and Datetime for timestamping. It could be expanded to include other features such as object detection, voice recognition, or machine learning to improve the accuracy of the system.
